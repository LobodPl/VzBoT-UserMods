# Better filament sensor for VzHextrudORT

![Sensor](Imgs/Sensor.png)

Based on ERCF Binky and has the same BOM.
Uses similar principle as hall effect filament sensor, but utilizes optical path blocking for triggering.

# Build
1. Order PCB from a manufacturer.
    Ones I have tested in the past: OSHPark, JLCPCB, PcbWay.

2. Solder all parts to their coresponding places (for now there is no possibility to get soldered sensors).

3. Print included STLs (You may use supports in magnet section).

4. Place 6x3mm Magnet in the printed slot.

5. Press fit sensor into the printed base.

6. Enjoy!
