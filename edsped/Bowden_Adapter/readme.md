Bowden Clip Adapter Using Spec'ed Mellow Collets, LARGE, and E3D Collets, SMALL.

I can't remember what length of screw was originally provided with the extruder but will need at least a 20mm long screw, I'm using 22mm.

Print with top of adapter face down on print surface as oriented in the stl file, supports not needed.
